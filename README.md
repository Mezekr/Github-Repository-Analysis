#Github-Repository-Analysis



This program is designed to analyze and visualize a GitHub repository.
It accepts the full repository name, i.e. user and repository name in the command line.
Then it displays the basic data of the repository in the command prompt and saves it in a csv file,
which is then converted to a data frame. Finally, it is displayed as a chart.

Example Input :

```
dotnet run -- octocat hello-world
```
